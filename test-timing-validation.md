# Test: Auto-merge Timing Validation

This PR tests the optimized auto-merge system to validate:

## Test Objectives

1. **Timing Measurement**
   - Build Only job duration (should be faster than previous 49s)
   - Auto-merge execution timing
   - Total time from PR creation to merge

2. **Safety Validation**
   - Does auto-merge proceed safely with only Build Only passing?
   - Are optional tests (Integration, Quality, Performance) truly optional?
   - Does the system handle pending tests correctly?

3. **Consistency Check**
   - Does auto-merge work reliably with the new workflow?
   - Are there any edge cases or timing issues?

## Expected Results

- **Build Only**: Should complete in ~15-25s (vs previous 49s)
- **Auto-merge**: Should proceed after Build Only passes
- **Optional tests**: Should run in parallel but not block merge
- **Total time**: Should be significantly faster than before

## Test Metrics to Collect

- Start time: PR creation
- Build Only completion time
- Auto-merge execution time
- Final merge time
- Optional tests completion (for comparison)

This test will help determine if the optimizations are working correctly
and if the auto-merge safety model is appropriate.
