##  Conflict Identification

### Basic Information
- **Conflict ID**: [CONFLICT-001]
- **Detection Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
- **Detected By**: [AGENT_NAME]
- **Status**: [ACTIVE | ESCALATED | RESOLVED]

### Agents Involved
- **Primary Agent**: [AGENT_NAME] - [Agent Type]
- **Secondary Agent**: [AGENT_NAME] - [Agent Type]
- **Additional Agents**: [If more than 2 agents involved]

### Conflict Type
- [ ] **File Conflict** - Multiple agents need same file
- [ ] **Dependency Conflict** - Agent B needs Agent A's work
- [ ] **Architecture Conflict** - Conflicting design approaches
- [ ] **Resource Conflict** - Competing for limited resources

##  Conflict Details

### Description
[Detailed description of the conflict situation]

### Affected Resources
#### Files
- `path/to/conflicted/file1.ts`
- `path/to/conflicted/file2.astro`

#### Features/Components
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]

#### Dependencies
- [Dependency 1]
- [Dependency 2]

### Impact Assessment
#### Immediate Impact
- **Agent 1**: [How conflict affects Agent 1's work]
- **Agent 2**: [How conflict affects Agent 2's work]
- **Timeline**: [Estimated delay]

#### Potential Consequences
- **Code Quality**: [Risk to code quality]

##  Resolution Strategy

### Priority Assessment
#### Agent Priority Matrix
| Agent | Task Priority | Deadline | Impact | Score |
|-------|---------------|----------|---------|-------|
| Agent1 | HIGH | 2h | Critical | 9 |
| Agent2 | MEDIUM | 4h | Moderate | 6 |

**Priority Winner**: [Agent with higher score]

#### Resolution Approach
- [ ] **Priority-Based**: Higher priority agent proceeds first
- [ ] **Time-Based**: Agent with tighter deadline proceeds
- [ ] **Coordination**: Both agents work together
- [ ] **Escalation**: Human intervention required
- [ ] **Alternative**: Find different approach

### Detailed Resolution Plan

#### Step 1: Immediate Actions
- **Agent 1**: [Specific action for Agent 1]
- **Agent 2**: [Specific action for Agent 2]
- **Timeline**: [When these actions should be completed]

#### Step 2: Coordination Phase
- **Communication**: [How agents will communicate]
- **Checkpoints**: [When to check progress]
- **Handoff**: [How work will be handed off]

#### Step 3: Integration
- **Merge Strategy**: [How changes will be integrated]
- **Testing**: [How integration will be tested]
- **Validation**: [How success will be measured]

##  Escalation Procedures

### When to Escalate
- [ ] Agents cannot agree on resolution
- [ ] Conflict involves critical system changes
- [ ] Resolution would significantly impact timeline
- [ ] Technical complexity requires expert input
- [ ] Multiple conflicts creating cascade effect

### Escalation Process
1. **Document Current State**: [All attempts and current status]
2. **Prepare Escalation Report**: [Summary for human review]
3. **Pause All Related Work**: [Stop to prevent further conflicts]
4. **Request Human Intervention**: [Clear request with context]
5. **Implement Decision**: [Execute human-provided resolution]

### Escalation Template
```markdown
**ESCALATION REQUEST - [CONFLICT-ID]**
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Agents**: [List all involved agents]

**Conflict Summary**: [Brief description]

**Resolution Attempts**:
- [Attempt 1 and result]
- [Attempt 2 and result]

**Current Blocker**: [Why escalation is needed]

**Impact**: [Effect on project/timeline]

**Recommendation**: [Agent recommendation if any]

**Urgency**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
```

##  Common Resolution Patterns

### Pattern 1: File Ownership Conflict
**Scenario**: Two agents need to modify the same file
**Resolution**:
1. Check agent-assignments.md for ownership
2. Owner proceeds, other waits
3. Coordinate merge timing
4. Non-owner integrates changes

### Pattern 2: Dependency Chain
**Scenario**: Agent B needs Agent A's work to proceed
**Resolution**:
1. Agent A prioritizes blocking work
2. Agent B works on non-dependent tasks
3. Clear handoff communication
4. Integration testing

### Pattern 3: Architecture Decision
**Scenario**: Conflicting approaches to implementation
**Resolution**:
1. Document both approaches
2. Assess pros/cons of each
3. Make decision (or escalate)
4. Update architecture guidelines
