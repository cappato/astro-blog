# Test Auto-Merge Fix

This is a test PR to verify that the auto-merge fix is working correctly.

## Changes Made
1. Added `opened` action to auto-merge workflow conditions
2. Optimized GitHub Actions usage (every 30 min instead of 5 min)
3. Added manual force-merge command

## Expected Behavior
This PR should automatically merge because:
- Has auto-merge label
- All tests should pass
- PR size is very small (under 20 lines)
- Workflow now includes `opened` action

## Test Success Criteria
- Auto-merge job should NOT be skipped
- PR should merge automatically within a few minutes
- No manual intervention needed

This file will be deleted after successful test.
